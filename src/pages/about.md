Steven T. Newcomb (Shawnee/Lenape) has been researching the history of U.S. federal Indian law and policy for four decades. He is recognized as one of the world's leading experts on the Doctrine of Christian Discovery and the influence of the Vatican papal decrees of the fifteenth century on U.S. law. He has published several law review articles on the subject. His book Pagans in the Promised Land: Decoding the Doctrine of Christian Discovery (Fulcrum, 2008), is the basis for The Doctrine of Discovery: Unmasking the Domination Code, a documentary film directed by Sheldon Wolfchild (Dakota). [Original Free Nations](https://originalfreenations.com) and [Indigenous Law Institute](http://ili.nativeweb.org) are two websites where some of his work can be found.
